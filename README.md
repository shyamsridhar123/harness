**Everyone blames the model. We think the orchestration layer is what actually matters.**

This is a philosophy of agent design — born from studying how agents fail, tracing the patterns back to their root causes, and arriving at a conviction: the harness (context assembly, tool integrity, loop discipline, policy enforcement, context lifecycle) determines outcomes more than the model inside it.

This repo contains the white paper, the architectural framework, a **hands-on prompt guide you can use today** to scaffold and test a harness yourself, and generative art that makes the philosophy visible.

## What Is the Agent Harness?

An **agent harness** is the orchestration layer around a language model — the runtime that constructs context, executes tool calls, enforces guardrails, and decides when each loop iteration should continue or stop.

> The model is the reasoning engine. The harness is the operating system and control plane that makes the engine useful, safe, and repeatable.

## The Five Pillars

A production-grade harness stands on five architectural pillars. Remove any one and the system collapses — not eventually, but within the first multi-step task.

| # | Pillar | Guarantee |
|---|--------|-----------|
| **1** | **Context Assembly** | Every model invocation receives a token payload that maximizes comprehension per token spent |
| **2** | **Tool Integrity** | Every tool call is schema-validated before execution, with actionable error messages |
| **3** | **Loop Discipline** | The execution cycle uses explicit signals — not heuristics — to continue, retry, or halt |
| **4** | **Policy Enforcement** | Every tool call passes through a permission gate before any side effect occurs |
| **5** | **Context Lifecycle** | The context window is actively managed as a finite, depletable resource |

---

## The Attribution Error

Most reliability problems blamed on "the model" are actually harness design problems:

| Symptom | Misattribution | Actual Cause |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Infinite loops | *"Model can't figure out when to stop"* | No explicit completion mechanism in the harness |
| Context exhaustion | *"Context window isn't big enough"* | Harness dumps full outputs without summarization |
| Destructive actions | *"Model doesn't understand consequences"* | No policy layer — no actions require confirmation |
| Tool misuse | *"Model doesn't understand the tools"* | Vague tool descriptions and ambiguous parameters |
| No self-correction | *"Model can't recognize mistakes"* | Harness doesn't feed actionable errors back into the loop |

## The Philosophy in Practice

Every pillar exists because of a failure mode that's well-documented across the agentic AI space:

- **Context Assembly** → Agents that don't know what tools exist or what the user expects aren't dumb — they're uninformed
- **Tool Integrity** → Malformed tool calls aren't a model problem — they're a bad API design problem
- **Policy Enforcement** → Destructive actions don't happen because the model lacks judgment — they happen because nobody built the gate
- **Loop Discipline** → $50 API bills from infinite loops aren't about model reasoning — they're about missing stop signals
- **Context Lifecycle** → Agents that "forget" their objective on turn 15 aren't forgetful — their context window drowned in noise

> **"Anthropic spent more time optimizing tools than the overall prompt."**  
> — Anthropic SWE-bench team

### Six Design Principles

1. **Simplicity over sophistication** — Start with the simplest harness that enforces the five pillars
2. **Transparency over opacity** — Surface the agent's state at every point in its loop
3. **ACI-native tool design** — Treat tool design with the same rigor as UX design
4. **Explicit over heuristic** — Prefer explicit signals over heuristic detection
5. **Feedback loops over one-shot** — Value controlled loops that self-correct
6. **Atomic tools, compound behavior** — Tools are primitives; features emerge from composition

## The Investment Case

| Investment Area | Durability |
|-----------------|------------|
| Model selection | Low — next release resets the advantage |
| Prompt engineering | Medium — prompts need updating as models change |
| **Harness architecture** | **High — the five pillars persist regardless of model** |
| **Tool design (ACI)** | **High — good tools work with any model** |
| **Policy framework** | **High — safety requirements only increase** |
